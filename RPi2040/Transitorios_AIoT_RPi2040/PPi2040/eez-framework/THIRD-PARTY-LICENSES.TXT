* Details:    Implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
              SHA-256 is one of the three algorithms in the SHA2
              specification. The others, SHA-384 and SHA-512, are not
              offered in this implementation.
              Algorithm specification can be found here:

              This implementation uses little endian byte order.
